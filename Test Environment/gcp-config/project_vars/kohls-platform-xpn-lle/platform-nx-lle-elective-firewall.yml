    # This section, while small, is for elective firewall rules that will apply
    # to the project. The idea here is that it is defined under default_vars/
    # and can be appled to any project in GCP. Examples of this would be
    # Akamai SiteShield or Splunk firewalls. This is new-ish so it's
    # implementation may change. But the upside is not having to manage
    # a hundred plus list of CIDR ranges.
