Hello and merry christmas IT friends, I am back with another python video, thank you for joining me. I am rocking the mike tyson ugly christmas sweater and today we're going to be doing some christmas shopping with Mike. We are going to be using the round method in order to tally the total cost of this sweater and few other gifts on our list. 


Before we begin, be sure to like this video and subscribe to the channel for Youtubes attention economy and without further ado lets get started.

-The first thing we want to do with any program we're writing is to state our objective. 
-Next we need to define our function that will be doing the rounding on the cost of our items to 2 decimal places. 
-We need list out the items we want to buy along with their cost and run them through our function.
-Last like any good American who particpates in overconsumption, we need a grand total so we can put it all on the credit card for tommorrow problems. 

So as you can see using the round method can help us determine the level of debt we wish to particpate in and is extremly useful when trying to simplify floats or numbers with decimals. Although I probably never be able to afford a rolex or a $85k vehicle, a guy can dream or just open multiple personal loans because its not like we're just printing money out of thin air, right? 

So I hope you enjoyed this walkthrough and the code for this video will be posted in the description below and as always, Ill see you in the next one!
