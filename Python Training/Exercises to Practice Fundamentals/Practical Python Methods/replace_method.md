'''# Task 6 - Use the replace method to complete a function that replaces the word POTUS with President of the United States and then print the new string.

# # Complete the function to replace the word WGU with Western Governors University
# # and print the new string
def replaceTitle(mystring):
    print(mystring.replace('POTUS', 'President of the United States'))

# # expected output: Western Governors University Rocks
replaceWGU('The POTUS is taking a snooze')
    
# # expected output: Hello, Western Governors University

Hello IT world, I am back with another python video, thank you for joining me. this lesson is going to be about using the replace method. We will replace an abbreviated title with the full title using this method and vice versa. Replace is a great tool for large data sets where perhaps one phrase or acronynm may need to be substituted with the actual word or another string. Again this may sound complicated, but practically the code is super simple to understand.   


Before we begin, be sure to like this video and subscribe to the channel to help us manipulate Youtubes algorithm. So lets get started.

-The first thing we want to do with any program we're writing is to state our objective. 
-Our data will be included in the print statement as we define our function. 
-Define the function 
-Now we want to print our words lists and also call our function

If only it was this easy to replace toxic leadership the world would be better off. As you can see the replace method is extremely helpful and can save you a ton of time if you're working with a large data set full of acronyms. You can even use it make correction in a document if say you mention someone 1000 times but misspelled their name. Dont get hung up on the small stuff, replace that bad boy and move on to bigger and better things. 

So I hope you enjoyed this walkthrough and the code for this video of course will be posted in the description below and as always, Ill see you in the next one!
