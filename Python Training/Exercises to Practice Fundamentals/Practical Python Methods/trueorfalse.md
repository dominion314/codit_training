# Task 3 - Use True or False to complete a function that will return True if the word 'nonsense' exists in a string or in our case a sentence. If it doesnt then we want the program to return False. 

# # Complete the function to return True if the word WGU exists in the given string
# # otherwise return False
def containsNonsense(mystring):
    if 'nonsense' in mystring:
        return True
    else:
        return False
    
# # expected output: True
print(containsNonsense('Not paying people a fair wage for hardword is nonsense'))
    
# # expected output: False
print(containsNonsense('The government has your best interests in mind.'))



Hello IT breatheren, Im back with another python video, thank you for joining me. Todays lesson is going to teach you the truth or rather its going to teach you how to use booleans. We're going create a function based on True or False logic and hopefully its truth will set us free.. 


So be sure to like this video and subscribe to the channel, and lets get started. 

-The first thing we want to do with any program we're writing is to state our objective. 
-Lets also write the string we will be submitting to a higher truth.

-We want to define our function that will return true or false based on our strings.

As you can see truth is a very definitive piece of logic, not to be confused with relative thinking. True or False statements are great for programs that determine whether you have enough money in your account or if your card should be declined.  

So I hope you enjoyed this walkthrough and the code for this video will be posted in the description below. Be sure to like and subscribe and as always, Ill see you in the next one!
