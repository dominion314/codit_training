Hello IT breatheren, I am back with another python video, thank you for joining me. Todays lesson is going to be about coming together, I am in fact talking about the join method. Using thie method we will take individual words into a sentence to make them as one. 


So be sure to like this video and subscribe to the channel, and lets get started. 

-The first thing we want to do with any program we're writing is to state our objective. 
-Lets also write the string we will be submitting to a higher truth.

-We want to define our function that will return true or false based on our strings.

As you can see truth is a very definitive piece of logic, not to be confused with relative thinking. True or False statements are great for programs that determine whether you have enough money in your account or if your card should be declined.  

So I hope you enjoyed this walkthrough and the code for this video will be posted in the description below. Be sure to like and subscribe and as always, Ill see you in the next one!
