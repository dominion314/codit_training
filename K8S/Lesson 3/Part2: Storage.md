   Persisting Data in K8s with Volumes 
    â–º  The need for persistent storage & storage requirements
    â–º  Persistent Volume (PV)

      The PV is the "U-Stor-It" storage locker - where the stuff actually resides. The PVC is the contract that gives you the right to use it, for now.
      A persistent volume is a piece of storage in a cluster that an administrator has provisioned. It is a resource in the cluster, just as a node is a cluster resource. A persistent volume is a volume plug-in that has a lifecycle independent of any individual pod that uses the persistent volume.
