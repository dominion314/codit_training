Based on the skills eval, Kubernetes may be the best place to start. 

Plan:
Basics for reference: https://kubernetes.io/docs/tutorials/kubernetes-basics/

-Work one on one to spin up minikube
    Jason will give access to GCP to spin up a Mac instance.
    Maybe kill two birds by showing them kuberenetes and unix CLI


-Walkthrough my kubernetes course
-Have them deploy a simple web application
-Show them how to create and use aliases
-Test their knowledege by breaking something and having them  resolve the issue.
-Networking??

Time:
-Spend about an hour with each intern (7).
-Follow up on technical issues that will occur
-Make the template available for learning outside of business hours.
-Developing the lesson plan should take about 1 week. 
-Working with each intern should take about 1 week. 
-Extra troubleshooting should take about 1 week.
